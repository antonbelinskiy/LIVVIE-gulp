                        Our LIV|VIE philosophy: wear clothes that make you happy, that are authentic & fit not only your
                        style but also your believes. Therefore we believe in wearing clothes that are designed to ‘be
                        better’, in every way possible; for our planet, for you, for your loved ones & supporting
                        communities in need. The luxurious silk is a natural fabric with a rich history, sourced and
                        processed in an ethical and socially responsible way.</p>

                    <p>Our mission to do better also integrates the ‘Slow living’ philosophy, a lifestyle emphasizing
                        slower approaches to everyday life to live conscious, meaningful and balanced. Endorsing this
                        lifestyle, we gave a lot of thought and attention to the comfort of the LIV|VIE Suit. We sought
                        for the right balance of elegance and comfort in our fitting to inspire and empower our
                        customers to live successfully, maximizing opportunities and overcoming challenges, as well as
                        encouraging relaxed and leisurely activities, moments to slow down, for self-reflection and
                        nourishing oneself.</p>

                    <p>Your signature Suit will give you that touch of confidence, power and elegance to face the
                        hustle of today’s society and harness every professional opportunity, as well as the comfort to
                        slow down and treat yourself with some loving me-time.</p>

                    <p>We believe that the combination of both results in a balanced, fulfilling and blissful life.
                        This makes LIV|VIE more than just a fashion brand, the Suit stands for a declaration of
                        authentic values and living a blissful lifestyle. So, slow down, take a deep breath and treat
                        yourself some elegance, comfort and authenticity.</p>
